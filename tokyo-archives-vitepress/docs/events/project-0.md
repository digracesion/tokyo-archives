# Project 0

## What is Project 0?

*Project 0 is  Tokyo Archives' first ever event. It's a one-day event focused on creativity and community. It is divided into two main parts: The Seminar and The Shoot*

### The Seminar

*Team activities to facilitate and encourage your own journey as a photographer, videographer, model, content creator or anything in between, lectures by professionals in the industry, and of course networking opportunities!*

### The Shoot

*A chance to experience a studio photoshoot with professional models, a makeup artist, and official lighting equipment. Concepts have been curated beforehand, so just come with your camera to shoot and have fun with it!*
